## What is a Service Mesh?

The term service mesh is used to describe the network of microservices that make up distributed buisness applications and the interactions between these services.

As such distributed applications grow in size and complexity these interactions become ever harder to analyze, predict and maintain.

Some concerns we need to take care of:

 - Service discovery
 - Load balancing
 - Failure recovery
 - Observability (metrics and logs)
 - Monitoring
