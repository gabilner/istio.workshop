# Deploying with Istio

- Our purpose today is to learn how Istio allows us to implement *progressive delivery* techniques

- We'll do that by deploying a demo application - an *alphabeth* system :)

- It's just a frontend service that speaks to 2 backends (aleph and beth)

- All the services are bare-bones Python Flask apps
