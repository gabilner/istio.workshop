      The slides should show up here. If they don't, it might be
      because you are accessing this file directly from your filesystem.
      It needs to be served from a web server. You can try this:
      <pre>
        docker-compose up -d
        open http://localhost:8888/workshop.html # on MacOS
        xdg-open http://localhost:8888/workshop.html # on Linux
      </pre>
      Once the slides are loaded, this notice disappears when you
      go full screen (e.g. by hitting "f").

## A brief introduction

- This was initially written by [Jérôme Petazzoni](https://twitter.com/jpetazzo) to support in-person,
  instructor-led workshops and tutorials
  
- Credit is also due to [multiple contributors](https://github.com/otomato-gh/istio.workshop/graphs/contributors) — thank you!

- You can also follow along on your own, at your own pace

- We included as much information as possible in these slides

- We recommend having a mentor to help you ...

- ... Or be comfortable spending some time reading the Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/) ...

- ... And looking for answers on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kubernetes) and other outlets

## Hands on, you shall practice

- Nobody ever became a Jedi by spending their lives reading Wookiepedia

- Likewise, it will take more than merely *reading* these slides
  to make you an expert

- These slides include *tons* of exercises and examples

- They assume that you have access to a Kubernetes cluster

- If you are attending a workshop or tutorial:
  <br/>you will be given specific instructions to access your cluster

- If you are doing this on your own:
  <br/>the first chapter will give you various options to get your own cluster
